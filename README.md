# To do before release
- register to Gym
- run experiments with Stable-Baselines agents and debug with Weights & Biases
- add rendering (render previous ep in the reset function and loop on it until next reset is reached ?)
- write readme
- comment and clean the whole repo (i.e. maybe we don't need all these files in space_physics/)
